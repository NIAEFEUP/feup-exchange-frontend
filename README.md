## Requirements
- Node.js

## About node.js
In a nutshell, you can think about node.js as a server.
It's sitting somewhere, just waiting for you to make requests to it.

## How to run the frontend locally
package.json is the file that helps generate the package-lock. 
Without package-lock you can't run the server. 
Important commands:
- npm install ____ generates package-lock files.
- npm start ____ starts a local server.
